        Who doesn't love to save time with a turnkey website? Here are a handful that I did with the help of Jekyll and Bulma. Jekyll is a static site generator that allows you to think modular, but
        doesn't require all of the extra overhead that comes with some other choices. Bulma is a CSS framework based on flexbox.
      </p>
      <p>With a little setup, these boilerplates can be deployed to Github Pages for FREE hosting.</p>
      <p>
        I encourage you to pick them apart, learn, and do what you need to do to make it yours. I'd love to see what you make. If you need any support or you have a budget and would rather have me do
        it for you instead, feel free to <a href="mailto:io@burden.cc" class="has-text-white-ter bold">reach out</a>.
