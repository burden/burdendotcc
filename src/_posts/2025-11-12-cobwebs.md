**Out with the old.** When this post is published, it will mark the end of a chapter for burden.cc. One where production was a `git pull origin master` directly on a DigitalOcean droplet. 

**In with the new**. Today, I have the CDN itch. It's actually been on the task list since 2020 and it's really about shouldering the hosting and administrative burden onto someone else, since hosting a static site from a VPS feels like playing with fire. 

So let's fix that. Github Pages is going to scratch the CDN itch. 

Here's the rub. I'm already using Github Pages for a stage. 

Netlify offers some interesting solutions for branch deploys, so I'm going to give them a shot. I have it setup so that when I push to the `staging` branch, I get a deploy. Also when I push to branches prefixed with `wip-`. 

**tl;dr**  
Removed: Travis CI, and Bower
Added: Netlify, Yarn

You won't, but [stay tuned](https://burden.cc/feed.xml) for more updates. I don't like the way Netlify is currently configured to deploy, and I would love to get some checks in place.
